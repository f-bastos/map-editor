# map-editor
Map Editor - an application where you can draw, save, erase and load your artwork.

This project was made during my sixth week at the Code for All bootcamp.
It's entirely developed in Java, using SimpleGFX as graphical library.

It's a grid where you can move a cursor and paint or clear any rectangle to create a drawing. You can save your painted rectangles, clear all and load your drawing, even after closing and restarting the application.
The size of the grid (number of rows and columns), the cell size, the color of the cursor and the color you want to paint are all customizable. 


Features I plan to add:
- a prompt for the user to configure the grid and color;
- the possibility to paint with more than one color.
